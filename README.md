# 📊 Airbnb Tableau Dashboard Project

Welcome to my **Airbnb Data Visualization Project**! This Tableau dashboard provides key insights into Airbnb listings, including pricing trends, bedroom comparisons, and estimated revenue, helping users explore rental performance across different zip codes.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Using a dataset of Airbnb listings, I created a comprehensive dashboard that visualizes:

- 💲 **Average Price by Number of Bedrooms**  
- 📍 **Price by Zip Code**  
- 🏘️ **Revenue by Property**  
- 📌 **Bedroom Distribution by Zip Code**

The goal of this project was to present Airbnb pricing and revenue data in a clear and interactive way to help homeowners, renters, and analysts make data-informed decisions.
